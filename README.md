  # Employee Summary
  ## Description
  For this project I was challeneged to build a Node CLI that generates an HTML webpage containing an employee roster. The user can input as many team memebers as needed and assign them roles within the company (managers, engineers, or interns). Once the user is finished inputting all employees, the entire team roster will populate the webpage.
